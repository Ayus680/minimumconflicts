# minimumconflicts
The Minimum Conflict Algorithm (MCA), also known as the Min-Conflicts Heuristic, is a local search algorithm used to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), such as the N-Queens problem, graph coloring, and scheduling problems. It is particularly effective for problems where an initial (possibly incorrect) solution is given, and the goal is to incrementally modify it to reach a valid solution
How It Works
Start with an Initial Assignment

The algorithm begins with a complete but potentially incorrect assignment of values to variables.
This initial assignment can be random or heuristically generated.
Iterate Until a Solution is Found

Select a conflicted variable: Choose a variable that is involved in one or more constraint violations.
Choose a new value: Assign the variable a value that minimizes the number of conflicts.
Repeat until there are no conflicts (i.e., a valid solution is reached).
Stopping Condition

If no conflicts remain, the algorithm terminates with a valid solution.
If a solution is not found within a certain number of steps, it may restart with a new initial assignment.
Example: N-Queens Problem
In the N-Queens problem, the goal is to place N queens on an N Ã— N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other (i.e., they cannot be in the same row, column, or diagonal).

Start with a random placement of N queens.
Pick a queen that is attacking others.
Move it to a position in its column that minimizes conflicts.
Repeat until no queens are attacking each other.

Advantages
Fast for large CSPs: Works well for problems with many variables.
Memory efficient: Uses only a single state at a time.
Good for real-world problems: Used in scheduling, AI planning, and more.

Disadvantages
Not guaranteed to find a solution: It may get stuck in local optima.
Dependent on the initial state: A poor initial assignment might require restarts.
